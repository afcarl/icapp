ica.p components

mm = mixing matrix
    mixing matrix (rows = channels, columns = components)

um = unmixing matrix
    unmixing matrix (rows = components, columns = channels?)

cm = cleaning matrix
    mix * unmix, shortcut to clean data (cm * data)

t = binary threshold
    if abs(some mm cell value) > t, the corresponding component (col) is
    considered 'present' on the corresponding channel (row)

fns = filenames
    filenames (in the order used) to perform the ica

c = channel count threshold
    if component is present on > c channels then remove it
    by zeroing out that column in the mm
